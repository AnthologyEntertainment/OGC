<h1 class = "monster-header" id = "monster-codex-bugbears">Bugbears</h1>

<p>Bugbears are the terrors that make other humanoids fear the night. They are cruel killers driven as strongly by a need to cause fear, pain, and misery as they are driven to seek food and shelter. A bugbear cares nothing about other creatures, even members of its own family, and has no motivations beyond finding the best way to feed its dark passions.</p>
<p>Bugbears and their albino snow-stalking cousins, wikkawaks, are the largest of goblinoids, standing nearly 7 feet tall&mdash;or they would if they were to stand up straight, but most bugbears prefer a hunched posture. These hulking creatures weigh up to 400 pounds (or 450 pounds for wikkawaks). They have facial features similar to those of goblins and hobgoblins, but on squatter, broader faces. Their faces are bare, but the rest of their bodies are covered in rough, shaggy hair that is often matted or sticking out at odd angles. Despite their bulging muscles and prodigious mass, bugbears move with startling grace and stealth. Simply watching a bugbear stalk its prey, its bulky, top-heavy form gliding silently though spaces that seem too small for it to pass through, is enough to unnerve observers.</p>
<p>Bugbears are more likely than other goblinoids to live solitary lives. Their dislike of being dragged down by the weaknesses and needs of others makes them inherently distrusting of even their own clans and immediate families. This is especially true for wikkawaks, who band together temporarily only to raid villages or to mate. Both types of goblinoids are well suited to solo survival&mdash;their excellent senses allow them to identify threats while still far enough away to avoid those too great to overcome, and their natural stealth helps them journey undetected to hidden places in which to sleep or store a cache of supplies. Of course, lone bugbears are more vulnerable to being hunted down when sick or injured, and knowledge of this weakness keeps them cautious. An injured bugbear on its own seeks prey weak enough to pose little risk, even as it hopes the prey will be strong enough to be tormented for weeks or months.</p>
<p>Once a lone bugbear begins to grow infirm from age, it must either convince a group to take it in, or skulk in the shadows, avoiding all risks and pining after past glories. While bugbears are not generous creatures, a fair-sized bugbear clan is often willing to take in an elder for two reasons. First, the newcomer's infirmity makes it less of a threat to existing leaders of the clan. Second, an old bugbear is considered a wily bugbear, likely to know the secrets of silently stalking and killing. While bugbears have little use for most other forms of knowledge, reliable lessons and anecdotes on these subjects are valued as both wisdom and entertainment.</p>
<p>The typical bugbear clan is little more than a family with a history of not betraying each other overly much, and is thus extremely fragile. A bugbear may decide it would rather prey on members of its clan than on more distant victims, scarcity often forces bugbear families to fight among themselves for food and shelter, and one bugbear might simply attack another for no reason at all. No laws or stabilizing traditions prevent a single incident from becoming an all-out conflict. Conflicts often tear the fragile clan apart unless a new leader rises from the carnage and enforces a semblance of order.</p>
<p>The few stable bugbear societies tend to fall into two broad categories: bugbear ghettos and cabals. In bugbear ghettos, a number of the creatures live under the rules (and watchful eyes) of a more stable governance. In some cases, this is a single powerful ruler such as a giant or dragon. That ruler must be powerful or crafty enough to instill sufficient fear into the bugbears to prevent them from starting trouble within its holdings, which is seldom easy. Such rulers employ bugbears as spies, torturers, and secret police, taking advantage of their natural cruelty, alertness, and surreptitiousness to keep other factions in line.</p>
<p>Bugbear ghettos also occasionally form in more organized societies, especially among hobgoblins. In these cases, the bugbears are treated as second-class citizens and forced to serve as scouts and mercenary troops. While each bugbear may be able to kill any given hobgoblin, organized hobgoblins militias can often keep the fragmented and selfish bugbears in line and crush any rebellions against hobgoblin rule.</p>
<p>Bugbears in such ordered societies are often more savage and angry than their freer kin, raging against the limitations that prevent them from creating panic and mayhem however they desire. While some may flee to attempt solo lives, a well-organized military or tyranny can impress upon small groups of bugbears that it is better to serve and live than to rebel and die.</p>
<p>The second form of bugbear society is the even rarer cabal, where a small group of bugbears rules over a larger population of other humanoids&mdash;often goblins, orcs, or kobolds. A bugbear cabal can't be considered a government or even a clan in the true senses of those words. It is instead a gang of thugs who have successfully taken control of some other group through pure bullying and extortion. While the cabal has the final say in the community, it leaves the details of governance to functionaries from the subject group.</p>
<p>While it might seem that being an agent of the cabal is the best position within such a settlement, bugbears enjoy terrorizing their most important agents as much as they love creating fear and misery among their lower-ranked subjects. A bugbear cabal rules through fear and random displays of force, and its subjects quickly learn that the best way to survive is to draw no attention at all. However, since someone must see to the needs of the government, the bugbears force senior members of the populace to do that work, and torture them if they fail in their duties.</p>
<p>Full statistics for bugbears can be found in their <a href = "../bestiary/bugbear.html"><i>Bestiary</i> entry</a>.</p>


<h1 id = "bugbear-new-rules">New Rules</h1>
<p>The following section details an archetype, new feats, a spell, and a selection of magic items favored by bugbears and wikkawaks.</p>

<h2 id = "bugbear-archetype">Bugbear Archetype</h2>
<p>Only the most vicious and bloodthirsty bugbears take on the mantle of the antipaladin; those who do so usually focus their vile power on causing as much fear as possible.</p>

<h3 id = "fearmonger-antipaladin">Fearmonger (Antipaladin)</h3>
<p>The fearmonger wants to do more than cause pain, misery, and confusion. He wishes to spread fear among his foes and infect entire populations with it. The fearmonger archetype is available only to the antipaladin alternate class.</p>
<p id = "feed-on-fear"><b>Feed on Fear (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, the first time in a round a creature fails a saving throw against a fear effect created by a fearmonger's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (including any ability that causes a creature to be shaken, frightened, or panicked), the fearmonger is healed of 1 point of damage per 2 antipaladin levels. If the fearmonger is at full hit points when this ability is activated, he instead gains an equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. Temporary hit points gained through multiple successful uses of this ability do not stack; the duration increases instead.</p>
<p>The antipaladin can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level plus his Charisma bonus. This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
<p id = "frightening-cruelty"><b>Frightening Cruelty (Su)</b>: The fearmonger must select shaken as his 3rd-level cruelty, dazed as his 6th-level cruelty, and frightened as his 9th-level cruelty. At 12th level, the fearmonger gains the panicked cruelty.</p>
<p><i>Panicked</i> : The target is panicked for 1 round per 4 class levels the antipaladin possesses. The antipaladin must have the shaken and frightened cruelties before selecting this cruelty.</p>
<p>This class feature alters cruelty.</p>

<h2 id = "bugbear-feats">Bugbear Feats</h2>
<p>The following feats are common among bugbears.</p>

<h3 id = "bushwhack">Bushwhack (Combat)</h3>
<p>You can subdue an unsuspecting foe quickly.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#improved-unarmed-strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: When a flat-footed creature is unaware of your presence and you successfully grapple it, you can attempt a second grapple combat maneuver check to pin the creature as a free action. If you have the <a href = "../ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.html#chokehold" >Chokehold</a> feat, you can instead use this second combat maneuver check to initiate a chokehold.</p>

<h3 id = "hurtful">Hurtful (Combat)</h3>
<p>You know how to add injury to insult.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 13, <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#power-attack">Power Attack</a>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: When you successfully demoralize an opponent within your melee reach with an <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> check, you can make a single melee attack against that creature as a swift action. If your attack fails to damage the target, its shaken condition from being demoralized immediately ends.</p>

<h3 id = "pile-on">Pile On (Combat)</h3>
<p>You can keep a foe shuddering in fear.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 13, Hurtful, <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#power-attack">Power Attack</a>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: Once per round when you damage a creature that is shaken, frightened, or panicked, you can choose to deal half your normal damage in order to extend the duration of its fear condition by 1 round.</p>

<h3 id = "shocking-bellow">Shocking Bellow (Combat)</h3>
<p>You can demoralize a foe with a sudden ferocious scream.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisite</b>: <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#intimidating-prowess">Intimidating Prowess</a>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: If you act in the surprise round of a combat, as a free action you can attempt a single <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a> check to demoralize a creature within 30 feet that can clearly see or hear you.</p>

<h3 id = "staggering-blow">Staggering Blow (Combat)</h3>
<p>You know just where to strike to temporarily stagger a foe.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 13, <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#power-attack">Power Attack</a>, <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#vital-strike">Vital Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: When you attack a foe using <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#vital-strike">Vital Strike</a>, you can choose to take a &ndash;2 penalty on your attack roll to also make the attack a staggering strike. You must make this choice before making the attack roll. If your attack roll is successful, your target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Strength modifier) or be staggered until the start of your next turn. Once a creature that failed its save recovers from the effects of your staggering blow, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.</p>

<h3 id = "strangler">Strangler</h3>
<p>You can choke foes with a lasso.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b>: <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#exotic-weapon-proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</a> (lasso), <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> (lasso).</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: When you successfully entangle a creature with a lasso and beat the target's CMD by 5 or more<i>,</i> the target cannot speak above a whisper and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + your CMB + the spell level) to cast a spell with a verbal component, use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. Additionally, the DC of an <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/escapeArtist.html#escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> check to slip free of a lasso you are using equals 15 or your CMD, whichever is higher.</p>

<h3 id = "visceral-threat">Visceral Threat (Combat)</h3>
<p>Your ability to threaten foes is great enough to make them hesitate.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisite</b>: <a href = "../coreRulebook/feats.html#intimidating-prowess">Intimidating Prowess</a>.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Benefit</b>: You may use <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/intimidate.html#intimidate" >Intimidate</a>, rather than <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a>, to attempt a feint against a creature within your melee reach.</p>

<h2 id = "bugbear-spell">Bugbear Spell</h2>
<p>Bugbears spellcasters separate their prey from support.</p>

<p id = "isolate" class = "stat-block-title">Isolate</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>School</b> illusion (glamer); <b>Level </b>antipaladin 3, bard 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> touch</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> creature touched</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> Will partial; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes</p>
<p>You cause the target to become invisible and silent, but only to his allies. Any creature with an attitude of indifferent or worse toward the target, and any creature that wishes the target harm, can see the target normally. The target can see and hear himself, can cast spells with verbal components, and can use command words normally, but any effect that requires allies to see or hear the target does not function. An ally that can see invisible creatures can both see and hear the target of <i>isolate</i> .</p>
<p>If the target succeeds at its save, the duration of the spell is reduced to 1 round.</p>

<h2 id = "bugbear-magic-items">Bugbear Magic Items</h2>
<p>Although any creature can use the following wondrous magic items, they are particularly popular among bugbears.</p>

<p id = "elixir-of-oppression" class = "stat-block-title">Elixir of Oppression</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 600 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 3rd; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;; <b>Aura</b> faint transmutation</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">This elixir is normally made from the juice of tomb herald brambles, though other formulae have also been discovered. It allows creatures with the scent ability to smell fear, and instills a bloodlust in the imbiber when it's facing a fearful creature. The imbiber gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> checks made with the scent ability, and a successful DC 15 <a href = "../coreRulebook/skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> check allows the imbiber to determine by scent whether a creature is shaken, frightened, or panicked. Once a creature's condition has been identified, the imbiber gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and opposed skill checks against that opponent.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">These effects last for 1d4+1 hours. If a creature drinks a second <i>elixir of oppression</i> within 24 hours of the first, it is sickened for 24 hours and does not gain the benefits of the second dose.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-breaker">Construction Requirements</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Cost</b> 300 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Craft Wondrous Item, <i><a href = "../coreRulebook/spells/scare.html#scare" >scare</a></i> </p>

<p id = "horror-dust" class = "stat-block-title">Horror Dust</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 600 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 3rd; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;; <b>Aura</b> faint necromancy</p>
<p class = "stat-block"><i>Horror dust</i> is the compressed stuff of nightmares. It is contained in a glass vial that can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. It shatters on impact, creating a cloud of hallucinogenic magic in a 20-foot radius that causes victims to suffer terrible visions and hear phantom screams. Targets in this area must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. If a creature is directly struck with the <i>horror dust</i> and fails its save, it is also confused for 1 round. Goblinoids actually enjoy the visions created by <i>horror dust</i>, and are immune to its fear effect.</p>

<h1>Example Bugbears</h2>

<h2>Bugbear Cannibals</h3>
<p>Some bugbears have an appetite for the flesh of sapient creatures, though they prefer consuming others over eating their own kind. They often keep groups of captives for weeks, killing and consuming them one at a time.</p>

<h2>Bugbear Cultist</h2>
<p>Bugbear cults are often small and short-lived, driven by strident cultists who hail themselves as prophets. The cultists consider themselves specially blessed with the power (and authority) to terrorize the world, and use their spells and curses as evidence of their special status. Most bugbear prophets rule over a small group of lesser creatures, often gullible goblins or kobolds, though sometimes they have a more unusual flock, such as dire apes, ettercaps, or howlers.</p>

<p>Bugbears worship in divergent, sometimes contradictory ways, and no one would call their religion "organized." Most of them simply utter occasional thanks to any demon lords whose names they happen to know. A cultist who comes along with a slightly formalized religious spiel and the ability to cast potent spells can sometimes convince other bugbears to follow him into a religious fervor. Cultists revere gods of battle, particularly demon lords. Their rituals vary wildly, and often involve violent blood sacrifices. A small number of especially conceited cultists consider themselves true prophets or living gods.</p>


<h2>Bugbear Sneaks</h2>
<p>Many bugbear sneaks serve as scouts and assassins for hobgoblin armies. They sometimes become enamored of the act of killing itself, and use their natural affinity for moving quietly to become unseen murderers in cities.</p>

<p>Arcane spellcasters among bugbears are typically sorcerers&mdash;few bugbears have enough interest or patience to follow arcane paths such as wizardry that require study or control. Bugbears call those with natural magical talent bloodmages, and treat their spellcasting ability the same as any skill&mdash;if it's useful for hurting, it's worth knowing. A typical bloodmage is interested in only spells that cause destruction and pain, plus a few supplemental spells to help her defend herself. Almost no bloodmages learn to create magic items.</p>


<h1>Bugbear Tyrant</h1>
<p>The bugbear tyrant is a mad agent of fear and murder. Once a solo marauder, he has gained such great power that cults have begun to grow around him as the chosen agent of a demon lord, and a crude bugbear nation is assembling to serve the tyrant. This is all beneath the tyrant's notice. He does not care who serves him, or what hopes or plans they make for themselves. His only mission is to spread terror and mayhem.</p>

<p>Though he draws other bugbears to follow him by his charismatic presence, a bugbear tyrant truly makes his legend by defeating and torturing other creatures. Bugbears care far less about gaining territory or forcing surrender than they do about inflicting pain and collecting heads. They're quick to recognize and appreciate the cruelty in an antipaladin's heart, and the supernatural ability to inflict pain on others that he brings to bear.</p>
<p>The tyrant doesn't reserve his violence for enemies of the bugbear race. It doesn't take much for him to turn on his underlings and slice them up for fun, especially if he's growing bored.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-breaker">SPECIAL ABILITIES</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su)</b> A frightful haunter radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 30 feet to take a &ndash;4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of a frightful haunter with this ability.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Create Haunt (Su)</b> A frightful haunter has so much rage and desire to create fear that it can actually create a haunt once per hour. Each haunt has a <span class = "stat-block-cr">CR no greater than the frightful haunter's CR &ndash; 2, and often takes a form either tied to the location the frightful haunter selects for it or inspired by the victims the frightful haunter hopes to frighten.</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-2">Unlike a typical haunt, those created by a frightful haunter are destroyed when neutralized, and fade away after a number of days equal to the creator's Hit Dice. A frightful haunter cannot have more than 1 haunt active per HD; if any haunt is created that exceeds that limit, the oldest active haunt is neutralized.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Fear Eater (Su)</b> A frightful haunter has an amount of fast healing equal to the number of creatures within 30 feet currently suffering from a fear effect.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Made of Fear (Su)</b> A frightful haunter is immune to the effects of a haunt, even those it does not create.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Terrifying Touch (Su)</b> A creature struck by a frightful haunter's touch attack takes 3d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds at the save can't be made shaken by the terrifying touch for 24 hours, but can still take damage from it. Successfully using terrifying touch multiple times extends only the duration of its effect; it does not create a stronger fear condition. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the desire to cause fear and misery survives even when a bugbear dies. Such a creature can detach part of its vile nature to create frightening spiritual traps in the form of haunts. Whenever possible, a frightful haunter learns about a group before building haunts to terrify it, and customizes the haunts' effects based on its victims' fears and weaknesses. If a frightful haunter is forced to confront a group directly, it attempts to create a stronghold of damaging haunts, attacking only when the group neutralizes one of the haunts, and then fleeing to another prepared location.</p>



<h1 id = "bugbear-encounters">Encounters</h1>
<p>While bugbears are sometimes encountered alone, they often band together to raid, scout, murder, or terrorize.</p>

<h2>Bugbear Raiding Party (CR 6)</h2>
<p>This raiding party is out to find victims who've fallen behind caravans or strayed too far from villages or farms.</p>

<h2>Bugbear Scouts (CR 9)</h2>
<p>Either working for hobgoblins or some other master, these scouts are silent and lethal, working in concert to eliminate their master's foes.</p>

<h2>Bugbear Murder Gang	(CR 11)</h2>
<p>Often the best way to spread fear and misery is to kill a beloved member of a community. This group of bugbears wishes to demoralize a town prior to a larger invasion, and is sneaking in to kill a respected council member.</p>

<h2>Inner Circle (CR 15)</h2>
<p>Clustered around the terrifying power of the bugbear tyrant, this group might represent the brutal core of a bugbear clan or another monstrous infestation. While these individuals likely squabble among themselves, and prefer to let their underlings do all the work, when faced with an opponent that actually threatens their rule, they operate as a team to viciously put down the interloper.</p>
